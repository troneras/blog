**Nobody Likes Programming**

> "Programming isn't about what you know; it's about what you can figure out."
> — Chris Pine

Programming today resembles the twilight of **disco fever in the late 70s**. Instead of _bell-bottom trousers_ and _shiny jackets_, today's programmers don **hoodies**, **headphones**, and ironically stylish _mustaches_. Programming has become **over-commercialized**, burdened by legacy code, while constantly chasing the latest frameworks—much like dancers unsure of today's choreography. The lucky few who mastered the right steps at the right time landed prestigious gigs _(think FANG companies)_ and now dictate how programming "should" be done. Amidst all the noise, many forget **why** they started programming in the first place.

Apologies in advance if you genuinely enjoy programming and feel this is unfair—but consider this carefully:

> "You might not love programming itself. More likely, you enjoy solving problems, the thrill of seeing your ideas come to life, and getting rewarded for making machines do useful things."

Allow me to reintroduce you to **Rock & Roll**, the purest form of music. Picture a group of friends grabbing whatever instruments they find, without formal training, copying classic bands, and inventing entirely new genres. This raw creativity is what's happening right now with **AI**:

> "AI empowers people to creatively solve problems by combining solutions from fields they barely understand."

Every programming niche is a **rabbit hole**. You might envision incredible possibilities, but diving deep usually means _months or years_ of intense learning before you can bring your initial dreams to reality. Each framework, language, or tool demands significant investment: Python, JavaScript, Rust, Kubernetes, or cloud computing—each is its universe, filled with concepts, complexities, and best practices that continually evolve. Yet the goal is clear: to create something meaningful, impactful, and innovative.

AI has transformed this daunting abyss into a manageable morning walk. In a single day, you could:

- Scrape data from the web.
- Perform sophisticated statistical analyses.
- Train your own **LLM**.
- Top it off with procedural **3D rendering**.

All this, with general knowledge and foundational computer science skills. The barrier to entry has drastically lowered, enabling newcomers and veterans alike to innovate without extensive prior knowledge.

**Examples are everywhere:**

- AI is revolutionizing **web development** with automatic debugging, error prediction, and auto-completion features that minimize human oversight.
- AI is optimizing **databases** by analyzing query patterns, recommending indexes, and identifying bottlenecks—all without deep expertise.
- AI is creating stunning **visual effects** and animations, democratizing creativity by allowing artists and developers to achieve complex results effortlessly.

Consider a scenario: Imagine you have an idea for an app that assists small businesses with customer relations through personalized automated responses. Previously, you would need months to develop the backend, fine-tune your algorithms, and implement a reliable infrastructure. Today, leveraging AI-driven tools like OpenAI, Hugging Face, or cloud-based AI services, you can prototype and deploy a fully functional version within weeks, if not days.

Moreover, AI not only speeds up development—it also inspires creativity by removing tedious barriers. You can focus purely on strategic decisions, creative thinking, and human-centered design. The time you save can be invested in refining the user experience, conducting detailed market research, or iterating rapidly based on real-time user feedback.

Yet, with this power comes responsibility. As AI takes on an increasing role in programming, the skill of asking the right questions becomes paramount. Knowing how to frame problems clearly, accurately specifying desired outcomes, and critically evaluating AI outputs will distinguish successful programmers in this new landscape. It's about understanding not just how to use AI tools, but how to integrate them effectively into comprehensive solutions.

If you're not leveraging **AI** in your coding process, you risk becoming irrelevant. Nobody's forcing you to remain in this fast-changing landscape—you could always retire to a peaceful farm. But if you choose to stay:

> **Focus on delivering solutions—not just lines of code—because today, code itself has become cheaper than air.**

Embrace this change. Rediscover why you started programming. Whether driven by curiosity, creativity, or a desire for impact, remember that your ultimate aim isn't merely to write code—it's to create meaningful solutions. Welcome to the future of programming, where your ideas are your most valuable asset.
